## Overview

Your Little Playroom Cafe website uses a simple content management system that allows you to easily update text content without touching HTML code. All modifiable content is stored in the `content/website-content.txt` file.

### What You Can Modify:
- ✅ **Text content** on all pages
- ✅ **Contact information** (phone, email, address)
- ✅ **Hours of operation**
- ✅ **Pricing information**
- ✅ **Menu items and descriptions**
- ✅ **Announcements and special offers**
- ✅ **Social media links**

### What You Cannot Modify:
- ❌ **Images** (must be replaced in the `images/` folder)
- ❌ **Page structure** (requires HTML editing)
- ❌ **Styling** (requires CSS editing)

## How the Content System Works

### 1. Content File Location
```
your-website/
├── content/
│   └── website-content.txt    # Main content file
├── pages/
│   ├── about.html
│   ├── contact.html
│   └── ...
└── js/
    └── content-loader-simple.js  # Loads content from file
```

### 2. Content Format
The `website-content.txt` file uses a simple key-value format:
```
KEY_NAME = Content that appears on the website
ANOTHER_KEY = More content here
```

### 3. Loading Process
1. JavaScript reads the `website-content.txt` file
2. Finds content keys in HTML elements
3. Replaces placeholder text with actual content
4. Updates the website automatically

### Step 3: Make Your Changes
1. **Find** the content key you want to modify
2. **Edit** the text after the `=` sign
3. **Save** the file
4. **Refresh** your browser to see changes
